# Website Carbon Badge
*Show how sustainable your website really is.*

The “Carbon Badge” is a digital emblem that signifies a website’s CO₂ footprint, directly sourced from [websitecarbon.com](https://websitecarbon.com). This badge allows website owners to publicly display their site’s environmental performance, promoting transparency and awareness around the digital carbon emissions topic.

## How to Use on your Site

It’s really easy to install it on your site, just add the following web component to your code wherever you’d like the badge to appear:

```html
‹carbon-badge background="#000" foreground="#fff"></carbon-badge>
‹script src="carbon-badge.js"></script>
```

## Customization

To make it look good on your site you can adjust fore- and background color.
